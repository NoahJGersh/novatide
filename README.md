# Novatide System

![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green)

This system supports the Novatide TTRPG ruleset, designed around the cosmology of the Vastest Sea. It was built in large part on the [Boilerplate System](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate).

No support or guarantees are being made here yet, as the Novatide system is in very early development.
